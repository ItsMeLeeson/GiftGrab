# GiftGrab
Enables the gift grab event in Counter Strike: Source. Picked up drops will count towards the Gift Grab achievement.

**About:**
* Replicates the Gift Grab 2011 event that Valve had for the game.
* Same event window used for what v72 (2011 Chirstmas) of the game had.
* Event window of 1st of December to 1st of January the next year (inclusive).
* Gifts have a drop rate of 20% when players die (same as 2011 event).
* Fixes the Gift Grab achievement by allowing progress to be made by the dropped gifts.

**Installation:**
* Download the .smx file and place it in your servers \addons\sourcemod\plugins folder.

**To note:**
The gifts won't drop or count unless the machine running the server has it's system date between 1st December to 1st January. So you can either wait for this date or if your okay with changing your date for seasonal achievements then that's also an option.
